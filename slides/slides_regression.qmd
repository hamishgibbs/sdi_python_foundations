## Challenge statement

**Objective:** *Predict the nightly price of AirBnB listings in London based on their characteristics.*

**Data source:** *[Inside AirBnB](https://insideairbnb.com/)*

**Dataset:** [2020-08-24-listings.csv.gz](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/soda_python_foundations/blob/main/data/2020-08-24-listings.csv.gz)

**Guidelines:** [Challenge](../challenge.qmd)

## Challenge scaffold

* Because we have so little time, I have made a "scaffold of the project"
    * [challenge_scaffold.py](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/soda_python_foundations/blob/main/challenge_scaffold.py)
* This is a *bad* solution, but it should be give you a foundation to improve from!

## Aims
* See the [Challenge Guidelines](https://hamishgibbs.github.io/soda_python_foundations/challenge.html#guidelines).
* By the end of the session:
    * Aim to make progress on each major item in the Guidelines. 
    * Start simple, then refine your solution iteratively.
