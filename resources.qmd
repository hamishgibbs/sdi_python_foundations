## Python

* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): *the official python tutorial. Can be quite detail-heavy, but it is also a great reference.*
* [Python For Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/): *the most popular course for learning Python. This course has lots of great resources and exercises.*
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/): *lots of in-depth articles and interesting Python projects. They also offer paid content. I always recommend sticking to the free stuff!*

## Git

* [Git Guides (GitHub)](https://github.com/git-guides): *a useful resource for basic `git` commands and installation instructions.*
* [Cheatsheet: Resolving Conflicts in a Git Repository](https://hamishgibbs.net/pages/cheatsheet-resolving-conflicts-in-a-git-repository/): *my own cheatsheet on how to fix a common issue for people learning git and working in shared repositories.*
* [Visualizing Git](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/): *a fun tool to visualize how `git` works. Playing around with this can help you "get" how different commands interact with each other.*
